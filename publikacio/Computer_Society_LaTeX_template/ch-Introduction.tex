\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{W}{elcome} to the updated and simplified documentation to using the IEEEtran \LaTeX \ class file. The IEEE has examined hundreds of author submissions using this package to help formulate this easy to follow guide. We will cover the most commonly used elements of a journal article. For less common elements we will refer back to the ``IEEEtran\_HOWTO.pdf''.

This document applies to version 1.8b of IEEEtran. 

The IEEEtran template package contains the following example files: 
\begin{list}{}{}
\item{bare\_jrnl.tex}
\item{bare\_conf.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_conf\_compsoc.tex}
\item{bare\_jrnl\_comsoc.tex}
\end{list}
These are ``bare bones" templates to quickly understand the document structure.  

It is assumed that the reader has a basic working knowledge of \LaTeX. Those who are new to \LaTeX \ are encouraged to read Tobias Oetiker's ``The Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX '', available at: \url{http://tug.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf} which provides an overview of working with \LaTeX.
