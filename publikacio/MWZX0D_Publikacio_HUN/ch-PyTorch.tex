\section{Why PyTorch?}
In 2016, Facebook's AI research group, now known as Meta, took the lead in creating the PyTorch framework and generously shared it with the global community as an open-source resource.
PyTorch has gained recognition for its outstanding qualities, being praised for its exceptional simplicity, impressive flexibility, and inherent efficiency.
These remarkable features have solidified PyTorch's position as a fundamental and highly regarded tool in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
