\begin{abstract}
    This paper outlines the creation of an artificial intelligence spam filter using PyTorch, grounded in neurolinguistic approaches, specifically natural language processing (NLP).
    The developed model efficiently identified and filtered messages that exhibited suspicious characteristics.
